# **HarmSpeech-AI-Tracker**  
### *Empowering Responsible Communication through AI*

---

## **Project Description**  
HarmSpeech-AI-Tracker is a robust AI-powered system designed to identify and analyze hate speech and offensive language. Using cutting-edge machine learning and NLP techniques, this project enables effective content moderation, fosters healthier communication, and promotes a safer online environment.

---

## **Key Features**  
- **Advanced NLP Models**: Leveraging TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for accurate hate speech detection.  
- **Data Pipeline Automation**: Efficient ingestion, transformation, and preprocessing of data.  
- **Real-Time API**: FastAPI integration for seamless prediction and deployment.  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design with Docker support for easy scalability.  
- **Cloud Ready**: Sync capabilities with Google Cloud Storage for production-level deployment.
